Arrays vs ArrayLists
- Arrays are fixed in size, ArrayLists are not
- Arrays can only store one type of data, ArrayLists can store multiple
- Arrays are faster, ArrayLists are slower
- Arrays are more efficient, ArrayLists are less efficient
- Arrays are more secure, ArrayLists are less secure
- Arrays are more flexible, ArrayLists are less flexible
- ArrayLists are more useful than arrays because they are dynamic and
can store multiple types of data.
- it can be used when you don't know the size of array or the number of ELEMENT in array.
